#### Notes from the chapter: Going Ahead with CNNs
* When we say that image of size X * Y * Z then X and Y values are intuitive because the image we see is 2d and hence we can have a picture of X & Y. Now Z has to pictured as a layer of size X * Y and number of layers depends on the value of Z. Usually, Z =3 corresponding to RGB. In Other words, There are 3 layers, one for red with X*Y values, one for green with X*Y values and one for Blue with X*Y. Now, these are stacked on each other like a cube. Now when a ray of light  passes through all the 3 layers, then the compound effect of lights results in the beautiful colored picture.
* since we have 3 layers in the input, kernel is also 3 layers but the output is 2d. i.e. convoluted image is 2d but like the conventional approach is to have multiple kernel, here also we can have multiple 3 layers kernel because of which we will have nd kernel output where n is number of kernels.
