    "* In text dataset, key terms are more important and we might no have enough dataset describing them. Deep Learning model usually expects many samples to understand the variance of a label. like image of a perticular flower.\n",
    "* Semantic relation between kitty and cat understanding also requires huge dataset for DL. If 2 words are similar then we have to share weights between them. i.e. the model should predict they are same when asked so the the internal weights of the model should indicate that the weights values are such that out of so huge NN (CNN) the trajectory of the word transformation for both the words are same."
