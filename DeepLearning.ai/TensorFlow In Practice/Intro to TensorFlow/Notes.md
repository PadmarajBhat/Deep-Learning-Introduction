##### Notes on Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
* Machine learning in a sentence: data + answer go into model and model predicts the rules mapping data and answers.
* executed the colab work to check if the increase in neuron for the first layer makes any difference. 
* flatten layer is the must if we are not using cnn but if we have cnn then conv2d can take 3d input.
